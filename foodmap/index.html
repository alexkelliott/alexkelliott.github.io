                    <h2>Refugee Coffee Company</h2>
                    <p>The Refugee Coffee Company is a place where refugees from many places, including Syria, can gain job experience and opportunities.  This will allow these refugees to earn a living, while adapting to living in Atlanta.  It also brings awareness to the Atlanta area of the culture of different refugee populations, such as Syrians, using food.  With the addition of a food truck, the Refugee Coffee Company is able to spread culture further throughout Atlanta and give more job to struggling refugees.</p>
                    <h2>Shami Kitchen</h2>
                    <p>Shami Kitchen is an example of how Syrian refugees tell their cultural story in Atlanta.  The word “Shami” refers to Syrian people, so Abe Malla named the restaurant this to show where they came from and their heritage.  They struggled to create a restaurant where they could express their culture, but through it they created Shami Kitchen, a Syrian restaurant, that tells their story using recipes from Syrian that have been around for years.  Shami Kitchen also helps employ other Syrian refugees and integrates their heritage with the food they create and sell.</p>
                    <h2>Gyro Chef</h2>
                    <p>Gyro Chef is a food truck and catering Middle Eastern company in the Atlanta area.  They show a unique way of spreading culture, as they are able to move to different places in Atlanta with the mobility of a food truck.  This mobility allows them to spread their food culture to different venues in Atlanta, which access different communities in Atlanta and can spread awareness of the Middle Eastern culture.</p>
