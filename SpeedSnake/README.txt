Speed Snake
by Alexander Elliott
CS 2110 B2 Fall 2019

Game:
    You are in control of a snake. You can change its direction, but you cannot stop it.
    Running into the walls, or into yourself results in a loss. The last row where the score
    is written is considered out of bounds and will result in a loss if you colide with it.
    As time goes on, the snake will speed up. Collect apples to grow the snake and collect
    clocks to temporarily slow down time. Be careful, because if you change the direction
    opposite to that which you are traveling, you will run into yourself and die.

Objective:
    Reach a length of 20 without dying
